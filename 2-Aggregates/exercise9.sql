-- In this lecture I learn about aggregate functions
-- Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.

/*
The most common aggregate functions are:

COUNT(): returns the number of rows.
MAX(): returns the largest value in a column.
MIN(): returns the smallest value in a column.
SUM(): returns the total sum in a column.
AVG(): returns the average value in a column.
